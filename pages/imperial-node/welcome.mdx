# Introduction

Hi, I'm pxseu and Welcome to the Imperial-node docs!

Few tips before you can set of,

## Parameters

`text` - means this parameter is **required** <br />
`text?` - means this parameter is **optional**

## Types

`URL` - means this type is **native** <br />
[`MyCustomType`](#) - means this type is **custom** and it's definition can be found in [Types](./Types).



And that should be about everything that you will need!
